# Robotic Terror!

Currently this is just a collecting place for sketches, doodles,
programlets and such to explore Ruby game programming, with a possible
general aim towards making a Sim X / Theme X / X Tycoon style game,
probably involving a robot theme and/or terror motif of some kind.

Until this changes, there's probably not much to see here besides Ruby
Gosu programlets in the `scratch/` folder.

Oh, and I guess you could always run `bin/robotic_terror` to see if
the game exists yet.
