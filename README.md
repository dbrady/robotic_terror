# Robotic Terror!

Currently this is just a collecting place for sketches, doodles,
programlets and such to explore Ruby game programming, with a possible
general aim towards making a Sim X / Theme X / X Tycoon style game,
probably involving a robot theme and/or terror motif of some kind.

Until this changes, there's probably not much to see here besides Ruby
Gosu programlets in the `scratch/` folder.

Oh, and I guess you could always run `bin/robotic_terror` to see if
the game exists yet.

# Installation

## General

Good freaking luck.

## Linux

1. Reread the section entitled, 'General'.
2. Google for "Gosu getting started on linux".
3. Take a moment to appreciate just how much stuff is required, and
therefore how incredibly improbable it is that this will ever work
4. Install all those requirements.
5. If they all installed with no errors, there is a slim chance that
this will work. Hooray!
6. If there were errors, refer back to step 3 and say "Wow, yeah, that
probably wasn't ever going to work anyway. LOL, why am I computering!"
7. Please feel free to contact anybody but me for help. I'm not trying
to be rude, I'm trying to save you time. I got through step three
without issues and that's literally the only reason I'm using Gosu. I
would be happy to commiserate, but seriously, I have no clue.

## OSX

1. Reread the section entitled, 'General'.
2. Get a computer and install Linux on it.
3. Go to the section entitled, 'Linux'

Actually there is a very good chance the Linux instructions will work;
Gosu has a page called "getting started on OSX", and if you can get
through that page you can probably sort out any other inconsistencies
here. I'm not using any special compiled gems or anything.

## Windows

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

Actually, supposedly the `releasy` gem will allow compiling all this
stuff from linux for Windows (and possibly OSX). If someone wanted to
try setting that up, that would actually be pretty awesome. As of
2014-04-22 we'd need to backdate the ruby version to 1.9.2, but so far
I haven't started using named arguments so that is still a
possibility.
